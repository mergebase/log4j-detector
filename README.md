<h1>Log4-detector</h1>

Scanner that detects vulnerable Log4J versions to help teams assess their exposure to **[CVE-2021-44228](https://mergebase.com/vulnerability/CVE-2021-44228/) (CRITICAL)**, [CVE-2021-45046](https://mergebase.com/vulnerability/CVE-2021-45046/), [CVE-2021-45105](https://mergebase.com/vulnerability/CVE-2021-45105/), and [CVE-2021-44832](https://mergebase.com/vulnerability/CVE-2021-44832/). Can search for Log4J instances by carefully examining the complete file-system, including all installed applications. It is able to find Log4J instances that are hidden several layers deep. Works on Linux, Windows, and Mac, and everywhere else Java runs, too!

# Introduction <a name="itemdetector"></a>

Currently reports [log4j-core](https://repo1.maven.org/maven2/org/apache/logging/log4j/log4j-core/) versions 2.3.2, 2.12.4, and 2.17.1 as **\_SAFE\_**, 2.3.1, 2.12.2, 2.12.3, 2.15.0, 2.16.0, and 2.17.0 as **\_OKAY\_** and all other versions as **\_VULNERABLE\_**
(although it does report pre-2.0-beta9 as **\_POTENTIALLY_SAFE\_**). It reports older [log4j-1.x](https://repo1.maven.org/maven2/log4j/log4j/) versions as **\_OLD\_**.

Can correctly detect log4j inside executable spring-boot jars/wars, dependencies blended
into [uber jars](https://mergebase.com/blog/software-composition-analysis-sca-vs-java-uber-jars/), shaded jars, and even
exploded jar files just sitting uncompressed on the file-system (aka *.class).

We currently maintain a collection of [log4j-samples](https://github.com/mergebase/log4j-samples) we use for testing.

# Understanding The Results <a name="itemresults"></a>

**\_VULNERABLE\_** -> You need to upgrade or remove this file.

**\_OKAY\_** -> We report this for Log4J versions 2.3.1, 2.12.2, 2.12.3, 2.15.0, 2.16.0, and 2.17.0. We recommend upgrading to 2.17.1.

**\_SAFE\_** -> We currently only report this for Log4J versions 2.3.2, 2.12.4, and 2.17.1 (and greater).

**\_OLD\_** -> You are safe from CVE-2021-44228, but should plan to upgrade because Log4J 1.2.x has been EOL for 7 years and has several known-vulnerabilities.

**\_POTENTIALLY_SAFE\_** -> The "JndiLookup.class" file is not present, either because your version of Log4J is very old (pre 2.0-beta9), or because someone already removed this file. Make sure it was someone in your team or company that removed "JndiLookup.class" if that's the case, because attackers have been known to remove this file themselves to prevent additional competing attackers from gaining access to compromised systems.

# Usage <a name="itemusage"></a>

```
java -jar log4j-detector-2021.12.29.jar 

Usage: java -jar log4j-detector-2021.12.29.jar [--verbose] [--json] [--stdin] [--exclude=X] [--oomThreshold=Y] [paths to scan...]

  --json                 - Output STDOUT results in JSON.  (Errors/warning still emitted to STDERR)
  --stdin                - Read STDIN for paths to explore (one path per line)
  --exclude=X            - Where X is a JSON list containing full paths to exclude. Must be valid JSON.

                           Example: --exclude='["/dev", "/media", "Z:\TEMP"]'

  --oomThreshold         - Specifies how many OutOfMemoryErrors should be catched during analyzing ZIP files before aborting the run as an int.
                           If 0 or negative, no OutOfMemoryError will be catched. If omitted, defaults to 10.
Exit codes:  0 = No vulnerable Log4J versions found.
             1 = At least one legacy Log4J 1.x version found.
             2 = At least one vulnerable Log4J version found.

# Frequently Asked Questions <a name="faq"></a>

# How Does It Work? <a name="itemwork"></a>

The Java compiler stores String literals directly in the compiled *.class files. If log4j-detector detects a file
named "JndiManager.class"
on your file-system, it then examines that file for this String: "Invalid JNDI URI - {}". Turns out that specific String
literal is only present in the patched version of Log4J (version 2.15.0). Any versions of Log4J without that String are
vulnerable.

This same technique of examining *.class files for String literals is further extended to accurately detect safe
versions 2.3.2, 2.12.4, and 2.17.1.

## This Scanner Only Reports Hits Against The `log4j-core` Library. What About `log4j-api`? <a name="itemapi"></a>

Many scanners (including GitHub's own [Dependabot](https://github.com/dependabot)) currently report both "`log4j-core`" and "`log4j-api`" libraries as vulnerable.  These scanners are incorrect. There is currently no existing version of the "`log4j-api`" library that can be exploited by any of these vulnerabilities.

At [MergeBase](https://mergebase.com/) we pride ourselves on our scan accuracy. You're already busy enough patching and defending your systems. We don't want you to waste your time with false positives. That's why we don't report any hits against `log4j-api`.


## Why Report About 2.3.1, 2.10.0, 2.12.2, 2.12.3, 2.15.0, 2.16.0, and 2.17.0 ? <a name="item2.10.0"></a>

Version 2.10.0 is important because that's the first version where Log4J's vulnerable "message lookup feature" can be disabled via Log4J configuration.

Version 2.12.2 is important because it's a Java 7 compatible version of Log4J that is not vulnerable to CVE-2021-44228.

Versions 2.15.0 and 2.16.0 are important because these are the first versions where Log4J's default out-of-the-box configuration is not vulnerable to CVE-2021-44228.

And versions 2.3.2, 2.12.4, and 2.17.1 are important because they are not vulnerable to more recently discovered CVEs such as CVE-2021-45046 and CVE-2021-45105.
Despite these being much less serious vulnerabilities, we anticipate everyone will want to patch to one of 2.3.2, 2.12.4, or 2.17.1.

## What are those "file1.war!/path/to/file2.zip!/path/to/file3.jar!/path/to/log4j.jar" results about? <a name="itemwar"></a>

The "!" means the log4j-detector entered a zip archive (e.g., *.zip, *.ear, *.war, *.aar, *.jar). Since zip files can
contain zip files, a single result might contain more than one "!" indicator in its result.

Note:  the log4j-detector only recursively enters zip archives. It does not enter tar or gz or bz2, etc. The main reason
being that Java systems are often configured to execute jars inside jars, but they are never configured to execute other
file formats (that I know of!). And so a log4j copy inside a *.tar.gz is probably not reachable for a running Java
system, and hence, not a vulnerability worth reporting.

2nd note:  for zips-inside-zips our scanner does load the inner-zip completely into memory (using ByteArrayInputStream)
before attempting to scan it. You might need to give Java some extra memory if you have extremely large inner-zips on
your system (e.g., 1 GB or larger).

## What About Log4J 1.2.x ? <a name="item1.2.x"></a>

Only versions of Log4J 2.x (from 2.0-beta9 to 2.14.1) are vulnerable to CVE-2021-44228.

## How Can I Be Sure This Isn't A Trojan Pretending To Be A Log4J Detector? <a name="itemtrojan"></a>

Great question! Since we include the complete source code here in Github (all 2500 lines of Java), as well as the steps
to build it, and since this tool has zero dependencies, it shouldn't take too long to carefully study the code to your
satisfaction. If you don't trust Maven you can go directly into the "src/main/java/com/mergebase/log4j" directory and
type "javac \*.java". That works, too!

We also sign the pre-compiled jar we keep in the root of the repository (./log4j-detector-2021.12.29.jar) with the
MergeBase code signing key.  Please run "jarsigner -verbose -verify log4j-detector-2021.12.29.jar" to confirm this.
